My personal engineering philosophy resides within the belief that the best software manifests when engineers repackage developers’ tools and technologies so walks of all life are empowered through their use.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m Nicholas, a full stack web engineer, fascinated with the intersection of physical and digital worlds. I have followed Hedgeye for many years, and have derived from content on Youtube as well as Glassdoor that Hedgeye values people who have a high degree of technical cognition, solid communication and the ability to work both autonomously and with a team. These are skills I have honed working on multiple projects, and I am confident that I would be a great asset to your team.

I am currently contributing to an open source and volunteer made application named FightPandemics, which aims to connect local communities and residents to medical professionals in emergency. I am currently working with a team of engineers and product designers on integrating AWS’s Websocket technology for chat capabilities on the between parties. At first I recommended WebRTC, but after some deliberation, I concurred  with utilizing Websockets as the better choice for the project. I do my very best to stay up to date in the latest technologies as I love adding new skills to my software development toolbox, but at the end of the day adaptability is most important to my success and future as a developer. This experience has been eye-opening and a great opportunity for me to gain a glimpse into a development process with over 300 people contributing; the MVP is scheduled to release in early October. 

My previous career as a medical assistant helped me develop many skills that seem to be underrepresented in tech - exuding clear, precise, and empathetic communication under stress is a skill that is not learned in many fields, yet nurses, doctors and medical staff tend to be vanguards of it as their profession demands it of them. Having a clear and empathetic communicator on your engineering team will help the team solve a variety of problems in less time and in a more streamlined fashion, and most importantly will maintain team cohesion in stressful times.

I would love to discuss further how my skills with AWS, Mongo, React, and Node and as a full stack engineer can add value to the engineering team at Hedgeye. Please feel free to contact me by email nhjlopez@gmail.com or by phone at 310-977-3170. Thank you for the consideration.

Sincerely, 
Nicholas
