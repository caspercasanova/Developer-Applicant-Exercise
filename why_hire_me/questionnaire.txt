What are your opinions on Agile software development?
To me, the most important principle stated by the Agile Manifesto is "Simplicity-- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-- is essential".  Simplicity is what keeps a team fresh and nimble by reducing the cognitive load of the code. It helps with refactorings, big or small, as well as allows new hires to gain a grasp on the codebase faster. The Manifesto fails to mention the importance of Code Commenting or Documentation of code, which I believe is vital to the sustainability of a codebase. It also mentions that "Working software is the primary measure of progress.", however, I'd argue end user empowerment and happiness is the true measure of success, but that is just me nit-picking. 

TDD or BDD?
I don't see why we can't employ both methodologies. BDD can be super beneficial in environments where communication between technical and non technical teams is paramount. TDD, while a must can easily grow complexity with no lasting benefits, it can also dramatically slow development speed. It comes down to developer experience, but making tests for a technical challenge you have never completed before can be, well, challenging. Either way testing is mandatory for the  longevity of both the application and the developers ability to reason with the codebase. I heard something to the likes of "testing is essentially hedging the marginal costs of outdated code" and I can appreciate such sentiment. Would love to know what the experience, if any, the engineering team at Hedgeye has had with BDD.

What are you looking for in a job?
Firstly, the chance to earn a livable income by working at a place like Hedgeye is a dream to someone who is passionate about Software and Finance. I have followed the company for a couple years, and have grown to deeply admire the companyâ€™s systematic approach to investing and research. I would suspect the engineering team at Hedgeye employs similar diligence in their work and would like to be surrounded by such professionalism. I want to work, learn, and build with kind and smart people.
